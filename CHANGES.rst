Changelog
---------

Our versioning scheme uses a two-digit year, a two-digit month, and a release counter within month. Previously the release counter was omitted when zero.

Changes necessitating migration reference the corresponding migration section. References are only rendered correctly as part of the Sphinx documentation. Within GitLab please find the migration document `here <./docs/migrate/index.rst>`_.

If we're deprecating features you rely on, please speak up.
